# Welcome to the Mo's Mons' SMP!

This modpack was designed for a long-term multiplayer survival world, so we've skipped on some mods that could fast-track progress and added mods that encourage building. For example, we've skipped on adding the Waystones mod as to encourage everyone to either build closer or to build paths/rails/trains to eachother.

!!! info
    - Minecraft version 1.20.1 for Forge
    - Server IP is `mrg.cloudnord.net`
    - ~260 mods (many of which are library/API mods that don't add anything)
      - You can find the modlist [here](https://mosharky.github.io/Mos-Mons/information_and_guides/modlist/)
    - The modpack auto-updates every time you launch it
    - We plan to connect eachother with trains eventually
    - Feel free to DM me (**@.mo_mo**) if you have any issues or would like to make a suggestion (please don't feel bad if I reject. I'm picky)
